# WhatsApp Channel Automation Feed RSS

ðŸš€ **WhatsApp Channel Automation Feed RSS** is a Selenium-based Python script designed to automate content distribution across multiple WhatsApp channels. This tool checks Feed RSSs from various Feed RSSs from blogs and sends updates directly to designated WhatsApp channels. The script is ideal for content creators, news distributors, and digital marketers who want to streamline their content-sharing process.

### Features

2. **Feed Monitoring:** It monitors the specified Feed RSSs for any new content.

4. **Message Sending:** Upon detecting new content, it formats and sends the message to the channel.
