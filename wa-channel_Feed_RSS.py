# WhatsApp Channel Automation
# This Selenium-based script checks all the feeds from Promecal's newspapers, launches WhatsApp Web, and automatically navigates through the channels,
# checking if there are new items in the feeds. When there is new content, the news is sent to the channel, and so on for all channels.

# Based on the script architecture from https://github.com/simbon/wa-channel
# Fork made by https://github.com/CarlosGHA/wa-channel_Feed_RSS
# MAY I HAVE A COFFE? FEEL FREE TO DONATE AT: buymeacoffee.com/carlosgha

*    This Selenium-based script checks all the feeds  *
*    from your website's blogs, launches WhatsApp Web,*
*    and automatically navigates through the channels,*
*    checking if there are new items in the feeds.    *
*    When new content is found, it sends the news to  *
*    the channel, and so on for all channels.         *
*                                                     *

*                                                     *
*    Instructions:                                    *
*    1. Once a new window opens in your terminal,     *
*       accept Chrome as the default browser.         *
*    2. A WhatsApp Web window with a QR code will     *
*       appear, which you must scan with the phone    *
*       that manages the WhatsApp channels you want   *
*       to automate.                                  *
*    3. After logging into WhatsApp and Chrome shows  *
*       the app interface, press ENTER.               *
*    4. The program will start the automation. Keep   *
*       the console open.                             *
*                                                     *
*    WARNING:                                         *
*    This version may fail. It is a basic automation  *
*    not intended as a definitive solution.           *
*    WhatsApp does not officially support this        *
*    third-party automation and it may be against     *
*    Meta's official usage guidelines. Use this tool  *
*    at your own risk.                                *
